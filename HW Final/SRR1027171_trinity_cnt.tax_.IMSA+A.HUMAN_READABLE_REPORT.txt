Section A

Taxon at the lowest clade associated with the reference sequence.
This report is most useful for detecting viruses, which can be omitted in other reports.

Section D

List of identified families.
This report can be useful when the sequenced organism(s) in the sample is not in the reference database.
Reviewing results at higher clade levels may prevent the identification of many closely related organisms.

Section E

Errors from analysis requiring human intervention

Sequence alignment conversion to taxa:
WARNING!
There were reference sequences which could not be converted to taxa.

SRR1027171_trinity_cnt.tax_unidentifiedTaxaAlignments.txt file contains blast alignments to reference sequence names.

These names must be manually looked up, input into appropriate files, and then the program re-run.
Please refer to documentation for detailed instructions to resolve this error, section 'Additional Output file'.

Reference sequence names conversion to taxa:
WARNING!
There were reference sequence GI numbers which could not be converted to taxa.

SRR1027171_trinity_cnt.tax_unresolved_gi.txt contains a list of GI numbers.

These need to be manually looked up, input, and then process re-run
Please refer to documentation for detailed instructions to resolve this error, section 'Additional Output file'.
